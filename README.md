GraphSuggestions
================

This will be a small part of python implementation for the backend server that will return suggestion given the domain and current order.

Suggestion feature backed by a graph. A lot of optimization using prime numbers, modulus, and bitshifts! 
Possibly might get rid of the DFS part if algorithm inefficient and stick with prime numbers search.

There are still bugs and needs to be fixed..
