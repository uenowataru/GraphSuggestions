GraphSuggestions
================

This will be a small part of python implementation for the backend server that will return suggestion given the domain, past orders, and current order.

Suggestion feature backed by a graph. A lot of optimization using prime numbers, modulus, and bitshifts! 
Possibly might get rid of the DFS part if algorithm inefficient and stick with prime numbers search.

It is now working!!
